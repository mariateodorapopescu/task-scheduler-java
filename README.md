	This project was completed in 2 days, excluding documentation time. I experimented with various parallelization approaches before settling on the final one.

-> Parallelization Approach
	I initially considered parallelizing each function used in the algorithm: `rescale`, `march`, `sample_grid`, and `contour_map`. However, I found that the most significant performance improvement came from parallelizing the `rescale` function. Therefore, I focused my efforts on this function to keep things manageable.

-> Thread Implementation
	In order to parallelize the `rescale` function, I encapsulated its arguments in a structure. My inspiration for this approach came from a Java course I had just before starting this project, which covered thread creation by implementing the `Runnable` interface. This way, I aimed to experiment with a similar concept in the context of this project.
	The decision to use this thread-based parallelization approach allowed me to make the most of the available time and deliver a working solution without overcomplicating the process.
